# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Single price grid component

This project is about building a single price component using css grid that responsive for mobile and desktop. In this challenge, I use only html and sass. The sass file then compiled with Live Sass Compiler extension in VS code. For the stylesheet architecture, i choose BEM approach so the css code can be neatly organized.
